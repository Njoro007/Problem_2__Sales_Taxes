</p>


</hr>

<h2> Approach </h2>

<p>
	My approach to this problem was first to identify possible subroutines that may be required
	to be executed at any point of the program.
</p>
<p>
	Subroutines identified or implemented in this assessment are categorized and organized by topic into classes.
</p>
<p>
For this Problem Assessment 2 (Sales Tax), classes are:
1.	RoundFigures – This class contains methods that return different values of rounded figures and arguments that fill equations of a formula for the method to complete its task.
2.	Tax – This class contains methods, each with different tax formulas
3.	AppData – This class contains properties of different types of data and their data types required to complete the sales tax application
